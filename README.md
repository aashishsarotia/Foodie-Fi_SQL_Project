# Foodie-Fi Subscription Data Analysis

## Overview

This project is part of the 8-Week SQL Challenge and focuses on analyzing subscription data for a hypothetical company, **Foodie-Fi**, which offers streaming services with various subscription plans. The objective is to understand customer subscription behaviors, identify trends in plan changes, and evaluate the overall business performance through SQL-based analysis.

## Dataset Description

The dataset consists of two primary tables:

### 1. **`plans`**:
   This table includes information about the different subscription plans offered by Foodie-Fi. The fields in the table are:
   - `plan_id`: Unique identifier for each subscription plan.
   - `plan_name`: Name of the subscription plan (e.g., trial, basic monthly, pro monthly, pro annual, churn).
   - `price`: The price associated with each subscription plan.

### 2. **`subscriptions`**:
   This table tracks each customer's subscription history, capturing when they joined and which plan they subscribed to over time. The fields in the table are:
   - `customer_id`: Unique identifier for each customer.
   - `plan_id`: The plan associated with the customer's subscription.
   - `start_date`: The date the customer subscribed to the specific plan.

## Key Insights and Analysis

In this project, the following areas of the business were explored:

### 1. **Customer Lifecycle and Plan Changes**:
   - Analyze how customers transition between different subscription plans over time.
   - Evaluate which plans (e.g., basic monthly, pro annual) have the highest retention rates.
   - Identify patterns in customer churn by analyzing customers who have switched to the "churn" plan.

### 2. **Revenue Analysis**:
   - Calculate the total revenue generated by each subscription plan over time.
   - Explore how the introduction of different subscription plans impacts overall revenue and customer upgrades.

### 3. **Subscription Trends**:
   - Determine the most popular subscription plans over different periods.
   - Track subscription growth trends, plan upgrades, downgrades, and cancellations (churn).

## SQL Queries

The SQL queries used in this analysis include:
   - Data aggregation to find total revenue generated per plan.
   - Time-based analysis to track subscription behaviors.
   - Customer segmentation based on plan type and subscription longevity.
   - Churn analysis to identify which customers left and when they left.

## Tools and Technologies Used

- **PostgreSQL**: All data queries, aggregations, and transformations were performed using PostgreSQL.
- **Database Schema**: All datasets exist within the `foodie_fi` schema, which organizes and structures the data for easy access and manipulation.

## Recommendations

Based on the analysis, several strategic recommendations can be made to improve Foodie-Fi’s business performance:

### 1. **Enhance Customer Retention with Proactive Offers**:
   - Customers who downgraded or churned could be targeted with special offers, discounts, or loyalty programs to entice them to upgrade or stay with Foodie-Fi.
   - For example, offering a discount on the pro annual plan could encourage basic monthly customers to upgrade.

### 2. **Optimize Pricing for Annual Plans**:
   - Since the pro annual plan generates consistent revenue and offers long-term retention, consider offering additional benefits to customers who choose the annual plan. This could be in the form of early access to new content or a discount after their first year.

### 3. **Reduce Churn with Predictive Analytics**:
   - Identify early indicators of churn by analyzing customer behavior patterns leading up to cancellations. Foodie-Fi could implement targeted interventions (e.g., surveys, exclusive content) to re-engage customers before they decide to cancel.
   - Creating a more robust feedback loop from customers who churn can help identify specific reasons for dissatisfaction and improve customer satisfaction.

### 4. **Increase Subscription Conversion from Free Trials**:
   - A significant portion of customers may not convert from the free trial to a paid plan. Offering personalized onboarding experiences, tailored to the customer’s viewing habits during the trial period, can improve conversion rates.
   - Sending reminders as the trial ends and showcasing premium features of the paid plans may help in retaining customers who are undecided.

### 5. **Consider Bundling Plans**:
   - Explore offering bundled packages where customers can get access to more services (e.g., streaming + other related services) at a discounted rate, encouraging higher subscription uptake, especially for the pro plans.

## Conclusion

This project provides insights into how businesses like Foodie-Fi can leverage SQL to analyze customer subscription behaviors, optimize pricing models, and improve retention strategies. The analysis helps identify revenue opportunities, customer satisfaction trends, and potential risks of customer churn, offering data-driven solutions to enhance the subscription business model.
